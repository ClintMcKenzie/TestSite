      <p class="homepage-text">
        The United States Academic Decathlon is a program in which high school
        students compete in seven areas of academic study and three areas of
        presentation, along with a team jeopardy event at the end of each
        competition.&nbsp; In Kansas, each competing school forms a team and
        competes in a regional and state competition, and the team that wins the
        state competition goes to the national competition.
      </p>
      <h1 class="homepage-title">Who We Are</h1>
      <p class="homepage-text">
        We, as the Academic Decathlon team of Shawnee Mission South, represent
        our school at a regional competition and a state tournament each
        year.&nbsp; Upon winning the state tournament for Kansas (which we have
        won 22 out of the last 24 years), our team advances to the national
        tournament, held in one of the competing states around the US.&nbsp;
        This year, our team captains were Eleanor Jones and Grace Markum, and
        our sponsors were Carolyn Cook and Patrick Grant.&nbsp; We usually meet
        for about 40 minutes every Tuesday and Thursday to study for the
        competitions.
